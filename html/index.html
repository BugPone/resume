        <br><u><b>What did it do?</b></u> It lets users flag one another, where if enough unique users flag one user, it performs an action on the flagged user. I built <a href="https://youtu.be/fLJBzhcSWTk?t=108">Socrate's tradjedy</a>.
        <br> &emsp;- <b>MySQL </b> to support settings editable by the chatroom owner and log usage statistics to gain potential insights. <small>I did not host this version publicly.</small>

        <br><br><b><u>Notable challenges...</b></u> 
        <br>- <b>Hosting and Maintence: </b>Trying to keep uptime and functionality despite deprecated APIs and <a href = "https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413259614487-Message-Content-Intent-Alternatives-Workarounds">mandatory changes</a>.
        <br>- <b>Managing cloud costs: </b>Reading cost reports and trimming unused resources. 
        <br>- <b>Memory leak: </b>Keeping track of the votes that are occuring and ensuring they are deleted when they votes expire or are done. Undeleted votes would have piled up in RAM, eating memory until the next reboot.
        <br>- <b>Protecting users: </b>Not leaking keys <small>(probably)</small> and preventing odd use cases from manipulating vote counts.
        <!--<br>&emsp;- <b>Little resources: </b>Low RAM / CPU (free servers), so only store group/vote variables no longer than needed.-->

        <br>- <b>Resourcefullness: </b>Built from basic Java libraries - using an actual game engine was not allowed.
        <br>- <b>Resourcefullness: </b>Base physics code from <a href = "https://youtu.be/K9qMm3JbOH0?t=3289">this</a> YouTube tutorial, which was severely expanded upon.
        <br>- <b>Creativity: </b>I made a tool to make custom maps. It gave our project a custom flare during the presentation day that others did not have! <small> It was also laggy and worse than O(N^2), but a quick and dirty O(N^2) tool was all we needed.</small>
        <!--<br>- <b>Why I had to be resourceful: </b> The professor said to pick a game and build it with <i>basic Java libraries</i> in X amount of time. Little to no information on how to program a game was given, outside of how to draw a box on a screen.
        This was CS151, most student's first programming project: I knew that somebody in our group had to get the ball rolling...

All the assignments of that class had bugs, I just knew how to not let mine manifest <small>(Ever tried running into a wall really fast to see if you can noclip? Ball bounce position is calculated with the position of the ball relative to the cube it hit, so a ball traveling too fast and colliding with a small cube can be seen as being on the wrong side of a cube, and will therefore bounce in the wrong direction - so I made speed of the ball low).</small>

          <br> - I sometimes helped other students complete these assignments and troubleshoot their code, even hosted chatrooms back in college. I also ocassionally help other Roblox programmers. I generally try to help where I can, but cannot help everybody.
          <br> - It's in C++, but I've never implemented my own C++ class. A lot of it was boilerplate from our professor.
